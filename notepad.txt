  Make new test state with cards in deck

AttackInterface

ClickManager
  When a card is clicked on, just emit a clicked on signal?

EventLog


Replicate tilt perspective

Switch card images to load from AWS
  Might also require having the card images in
  the exact size we want to display to fix blurry images.

How do we handle the GameContainerResizer thing to make sure
the game scales correctly?


Serious consideration.
  We make the front end rerender the game board after every event.
  In react, this is very fast. But is it fast in godot?
    Do card images reload, etc?







DATA STRUCTURE:
Add the AttackInterface checks and energy provisions 
to the localBattleState during syncCardData and send it to the front end



Remember to install the godot mcp server at somepoint
